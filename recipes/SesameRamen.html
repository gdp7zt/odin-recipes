    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is an easy way to still make a cheap ramen recipe while also elevating it past just making the ramen packets. I loved eating this
        while I was in college and still to this day it is quick and easy to make. It requires only a few ingredients other than the normal ramen
        packages, so it works well for being in the dorms also. A huge hit, but it does require someone to be in the mood for it.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 blocks of ramen noodles</li>
        <li>2 tsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>I like to add some spice, so I use some sriracha</li>
        <li>Optional eggs or tofu to add in</li>
        <li>optional sesame seeds or green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water to a boil and add in ramen, drain when done</li>
        <li>If you are using eggs or tofu, scramble the eggs or fry the tofu at this point as well (I cook mine in the sesame oil)</li>
        <li>When the eggs and tofu are done, add in the garlic and let it cook for 1-2 minutes, then add the sauce ingredients and cook until slightly thicker</li>
        <li>Add in the noodles and stir to combine and coat with the sauce</li>
        <li>Top with sesame seeds and or green onions and serve warm!</li>
    </ol>
